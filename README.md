### Running the Robot Manually

When the robot is powered on, you will see on orange light blinking quickly on the RC receiver. 
To connect the RC controller, press and hold the trainer switch on the upper left hand side of the controller then switch it on.

Continue to hold the trainer switch until the light on the RC receiver is continuously on.

At that point the motor controller will take RC inputs and you can maneuver the robot with the right hand stick.
